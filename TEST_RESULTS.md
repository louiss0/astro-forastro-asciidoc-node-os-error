# Node:os Error Testing Results

## Summary
The `node:os` error has been confirmed to occur consistently across all Astro operations that involve content collection processing.

## Error Details

### Error Message
```
Dynamic require of "node:os" is not supported
```

### Full Error Context
```
[GenerateContentTypesError] `astro sync` command failed to generate content collection types: Dynamic require of "node:os" is not supported
```

### Error Location
The error originates from the `@forastro/asciidoc` package:
```
/node_modules/.pnpm/@forastro+asciidoc@2.3.2_astro@5.12.8_@types+node@24.2.0_jiti@2.5.1_rollup@4.46.2_types_bb9f723493abc33e9e95b288c1718144/node_modules/@forastro/asciidoc/index.js
```

## Test Results

### 1. Development Server (`pnpm run dev`)
- **Result**: Server starts but shows error warning
- **Error Output**: 
  ```
  [ERROR] [content] Dynamic require of "node:os" is not supported
  [WARN] [content] Content config not loaded
  ```
- **Impact**: Development server runs but content collections are not properly loaded

### 2. Build Process (`pnpm run build`)
- **Result**: Build fails completely
- **Error Output**: Full stack trace with GenerateContentTypesError
- **Impact**: Cannot build project for production

### 3. Astro Sync (`pnpm astro sync`)
- **Result**: Command fails
- **Error Output**: Same GenerateContentTypesError as build
- **Impact**: Cannot generate content collection types

## Consistency
The error presents itself **consistently** across all tested scenarios:
- ✅ Occurs in development mode
- ✅ Occurs during build process
- ✅ Occurs during astro sync
- ✅ Always points to the same source (@forastro/asciidoc package)

## Root Cause
The issue stems from the `@forastro/asciidoc` package attempting to use a dynamic require statement for the `node:os` module, which is not supported in the current bundling/evaluation context used by Vite and Astro's content collection system.

## Impact Assessment
- **Development**: Partially functional (server runs but content collections fail)
- **Production**: Completely blocked (cannot build)
- **Type Generation**: Blocked (cannot sync content types)
